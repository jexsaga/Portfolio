            This is the first robot model for a 3D game I am making in Unity in partnership with a fellow student at IP - Paris.
            It includes a basic rig for animation and is designed to be simple as per our game aesthetic.

            Focus: Making something beautiful and personal while getting to know the tools of Blender and Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next Steps: Add texturing and complete a full animation cycle.
